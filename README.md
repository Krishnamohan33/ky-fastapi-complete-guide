> A personal learning repository created while exploring FastAPI deeply.

Hello 👋  
My name is **Krishnamohan Yagneswaran**.

I am currently learning **FastAPI** and building this repository as a structured way to understand core backend concepts like:

- Sync vs Async  
- ASGI vs WSGI  
- Request/Response lifecycle  
- Validation  
- Dependency Injection  
- Authentication  
- Database integration  
- Deployment basics  

This repository will continuously evolve.

If I learn something new, I will update this repo.  
If you know something useful, feel free to contribute.

This is not a finished product — it is a living learning document.
